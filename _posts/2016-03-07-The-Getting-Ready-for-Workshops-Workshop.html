title: The "Getting Ready for Workshops" Workshop
---
<p>This workshop will be an informal and participatory session designed to help attendees prepare for code-related activities at Code4Lib and beyond. The intended audience is people who are new to coding or Code4Lib, or people who want help preparing their Mac or PC conference laptop for code workshops. The workshop facilitators will provide an overview and some hands-on time to prepare for five elements of code workshops: using a text editor; using the command line interface; setting up environment variables; running a virtual environment in Virtual Box; and installing a programming language (Python). We'll also share general troubleshooting methods and tips to help you get the most out of code workshops.</p>

<p>**Note: no need to install, we'll do that in the workshop. If you're able to download the installer files in advance, though, that will be helpful.</p>
